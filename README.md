# AIC2024

## Overview
This text-based multimodal search engine is specifically designed to retrieve log life events within videos. The engine is equipped with advanced search capabilities and can extract keyframes based on a lengthy series query. Additionally, it enables the identification of words within the images contained in the videos. Our motivation is driven by the desire to learn, innovate, and make a difference.


### Feature:

**Full-text Search**: This feature allows for searching keyframes across a lengthy sentence. Furthermore, our engine supports breaking down long-series queries into individual sentences, which is very userfull for retrieval.

**OCR Filter**: Utilizing this enables users to extract events from the text in the keyframes.

Besides, users have the ability to view the video associated with selected keyframes. This feature also enables users to observe the keyframes both before and after the chosen event, enhancing the overall viewing experience.
